Cancer seriously affects the emotional, physical, and mental state of patients. In the years after cancer patients are diagnosed, their quality of life will drastically decrease. For the physiological side effects of advanced cancer treatment, such as impaired fertility, sexual dysfunction, hair loss, and weight gain, patients will feel inferior or even will be discriminated against. Especially for families with poor financial status, not only must they consider whether they can afford medical expenses, but also how to face and deal with the despair and fear of death of cancer patients. Therefore, family members of cancer patients are also under tremendous psychological pressure, and their physical and mental health is also affected. Sometimes some patients cannot effectively control cancer pain with drugs, which will have a great impact on the patient’s quality of life and psychological pressure, including anxiety, despair, and fear. Therefore, understanding and coping with the emotional, mental and physical trauma of cancer to humans will maximize the quality of life of cancer patients and their families. Modern medicine has invested considerable human and material resources in cancer research for a long time, and has gradually understood and understood the causes of cancer; the diagnosis of cancer has made considerable progress due to advances in science and technology. In order to alleviate everyone’s anxiety about cancer, we would like to learn more about cancer in different aspects, and see whether the world has really made progress against cancer and by how much in this project. Specifically, we will combine different data visualization methods and frames to explore the deeply current situation of cancer around the world and the progress in the medical realm against cancer. In this projeect, three questions that we would like to persue are as follows: By how much is all kinds of cancer caused by genetic factors? What is the relationship between cancer survival rate and level of development (population, GDP, income, inequality, and so on) of a country? How does the world make propress against cancer over time? The data souce we find includes data on many different aspect of cancer, including cancer prevalence, cancer mortality over time, causes of cancer and so on. From these data source, we can get the information that how cancer is relating to our world that it not only affects each family but also influence sundry countries. During this pandemic, the discussion one health problems should be on the agenda urgently. Via merging different tables, we can extract the data we need, and find the conclusion of our above cancer related questions. Link to our book URL: https://maggieli99.github.io/Cancerstatistic.

"],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer 2.2 question 2 2.3 question 3", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data source for this project is Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and World Bank. GHDx is a catalog of global health and demographic data. It provides statistics and other information about all kinds of diseases for different countries and for the globe as a whole. We use the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) Results Tool built inside to generate our datasets about cancer in different aspects. The tool allows retrieval of GBD results and provides several variables for people to choose and combine. A brief introduction about the contents this tool supplies are as follows: Base: This menu provides 2 choices: Single means single year estimates, Change means multi-year estimates for select year ranges Location: This menu provides GBD super regions, regions, countries, subnational units, and custom regions (WHO regions, World Bank Income Levels, and more) to choose from Year: 1990-2019 Context: This menu defines the type of indicator results people can access. It contains all GBD causes, risks, impairments, injuries by nature, etiology, etc. Once we select one of these results, a new drop-down menu about that result (varialbe) will appear and we can choose the values of our interest. Age: All GBD age groups Metric(units): The choices are number, rate, and percent Measure: The choices are deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), prevalence, incidence, life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), maternal mortality ratio (MMR), and summary exposure value (SEV) Sex: The choices are male, female, and both If we generates the results for all measures for every single entry of the above menus, the dataset will be so huge and complicated since it contains data for countries all over the world for 30 years. So, to better conduct our analysis on several focuses, we generated three major datasets from GBD Results Tool and each group member was responsible for creating their dataset to solve corresponding questions. World Bank collects and provides large amount of global development data and was used as data supplement of countries’ statistics in our dataset. Details about the datasets are as follows: 2.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer Dataset: risk.csv The dataset is created from GBD Results Tool by choosing risk as context. Table 2.1: Risk Data Desription Column Name Description measure Variable name of interest (chr) location Location (chr) sex Sex (chr) age Age group (chr) cause Cancer type (chr) rei Risk type (chr) metric Unit of measure (chr) year Year (num) val Value of measure with corresponding metric (num) upper Upper bound of val (num) lower Lower bound of val (num) Issues with this dataset: The column “location” only has one value “Global” so it is not a useful variable in the dataset. And the columns “upper” and “lower” give a boundaries to “val”. In this project, we only used the “val” provided and not consider the range of “val”. So, “upper” and “lower” columns were also not used. The unused columns need to be removed. All the measures are assigned with three metrics: number, percent, and rate. Some metrics are not suitable to be used on some measures. For instance, percentage of years of life lost does not make much sense. So, we might consider deleting some meaningless or unused metrics to decrease data size. The dataset is not tidy. Column “measure” actually contains the variables of our interests. And “val” stores the values of corresponding variable. This dataset needs to be pivot to a tidy format. 2.2 question 2 2.3 question 3 Dataset: making_progress.csv The dataset is created from GBD Results Tool by choosing cause as context. Table 2.2: Making_progress_description Data Desription Column Name Description measure Variable name of interest (chr) location Location (chr) sex Sex (chr) age Age group (chr) cause Cancer type (chr) metric Unit of measure (chr) year Year (num) val Value of measure with corresponding metric (num) upper Upper bound of val (num) lower Lower bound of val (num) Issues with this dataset: Same as our topic 1, the column “location” only has one value “Global” which cannot provide more information. And the columns “upper” and “lower” give a boundaries to “val”. However, we only used the “val” provided and not consider the range of “val”. Hence, the unused columns need to be removed. Considering that the dataset size need to be reduced, we may delete some meaningless and confusing metrics. Here are three different “measure” way in our dataset, which we need to do tidy work to make them readable and clear. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer 3.2 question 2 3.3 question 3", " Chapter 3 Data transformation All of our datasets generated from GBD results tool need to be pre-processed as they are not in a tidy format originally. Please go to our github repo chapter to see code in detail. 3.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer For the risk data, we first removed the used columns “location”, “upper” and “lower”. And then we pivoted our dataset so that the combinations of measure and metric became new columns (variables) in the wider tidy data and values in val were placed in the corresponding entries. We also updated the columns names of our new data frame so that these names are more precise. Finally, noticed that all of our columns of character type have limited number of categories, we transformed all character columns into factors. After data cleaning and transformation, our cancer_risk data frame has much less rows and contains only meaningful variables. ## tibble [36,000 × 14] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ sex : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Both&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;,..: 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 ... ##

And then we pivoted our dataset so that the combinations of measure and metric became new columns (variables) in the wider tidy data and values in val were placed in the corresponding entries. To be more precise and clear, we need to change the column name for the metric. Last but not least, we still need to transform all character columns into factors. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer 4.2 question 2 4.3 question 3", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer The original risk data frame does not have any missing values since GBD Results Tool has already ignored all the observations with missing value.

It shows the information about in the global scale in 2019, the death rates of each kind of cancer caused by different external risks for all ages. We can see that the dataset is not in a tidy format. There are many useless variables that only contains one value. So below we transformed the data into a tidy format using only the variables of our interests. ## Air pollution Tobacco Alcohol use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 5.007384 17.5615609 NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA 1.8472622 1.302482 ## Kidney cancer NA 0.3893515 NA ## Cervical cancer NA 0.3894900 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA 1.0018858 NA ## High fasting plasma glucose ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 2.3140498 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.2611637 ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer 0.2949716 ## High body-mass index Dietary risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 0.9976335 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.1099461 4.7270238 ## Kidney cancer 0.4097576 NA ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer 0.4715473 NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Low physical activity Occupational risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 3.745323794 ## Colon and rectum cancer 0.7580853 NA ## Kidney cancer NA 0.001015075 ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Unsafe sex Other environmental risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 1.08179 ## Colon and rectum cancer NA NA ## Kidney cancer NA NA ## Cervical cancer 3.624948 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Drug use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer NA After transformation, we get a new data frame. Each observation is the death rates of one kind of cancer caused by different external risks. There is a lot of missing values in our dataset because not all types of cancer are related to all kinds of risks. For example, some types of cancer may be induced by air pollution, but will not be induced by alcohol use. In order to see the relationship between cancer types and external risks, we analyze the missing values in this data frame below. From the missing pattern plot we can see that for each of the risks air pollution, drug use, other environmental risks, unsafe sex and low physical activity, their values are missing for all other types of cancer except one. That means theses risks are highly correlated to one specific kind of cancer and people need to be care of those risks if they would like to avoid the specific types of cancer. We can also see that if data is missing for risk air pollution, then it is likely to be missing in for other environmental risks. It makes sense since air pollution is also one kind of environmental risk. It is chosen to be a separated variable because it accounts for a large proportion of environmental risks. Another thing of our notice is that risk tobacco is almost not missing for all kinds of cancer, which means it can be the induction of the majority types of cancer. So in order to protect ourselves from being attacked by cancer, we should try to avoid use tobacco a lot. We do not have a complete case here because no type of cancer would be induced by all the external risks. Below, by explicitly drawing missing values in each observation, we can have a better understanding of similarities in different kinds of cancer. From the plot above, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is affected by external risks the most since it can be induced by majority of the risks listed. It also has the highest death rate because we can see many of the blocks are yellow which means the rate is very high. Uterine cancer, thyroid cancer and gallbladder and biliary tract cancer have the same missing pattern. Colon and rectum cancer and breast cancer have same missing pattern. It suggests that there might be some similarity in these kinds of cancer, though not obvious now, but may help people find treatment to these types of cancer. Nasopharynx cancer and larynx cancer have same missing pattern. Other pharynx cancer and lip and oral cavity cancer have same missing pattern. And these two missing patterns are also similar to each other. It makes sense since they are all related to throat. 4.2 question 2 4.3 question 3 "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer 5.2 question 2 5.3 question 3", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer The etiology of cancer is very complicated and has not been fully understood. But it has been found that the two major causes of cancer are genetic factors and external factors. While one of the biggest fears of human comes from cancer and people usually feel helpless in the face of cancer, we should realize that keep good life style might significantly reduce our chance of getting some kind of cancer. So below we analyze the effect of external factors on cancer and give potential ways of preventing cancer. 5.1.1 Share of cancer deaths attributed to risk factors from 1990-2019 The plot above shows an estimation of share of global cancer deaths which are attributed to external risk factors over the 30 years. For example, around 71% of larynx cancer deaths are attributed to some external risk. Only the remaining 29% of deaths are assumed to have no attribution to risk factors, and would occur naturally in the absence of external factors. So, we can see that the cancers with blue bar, like cervical cancer and mesothelioma, are more caused by external risks; the cancers with red bar, like thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer, are more due to genetic factors and so that people can do less to prevent such cancers. We can notice that cervical cancer is 100% due to external risks according to the plot. It might be to extreme to say but it is a suggestion that people can definitely do a lot of things to successfully prevent having such cancer. We also observe that over the past 30 years, though the overall share of cancer deaths due to external risks is not changing dramatically, the external risk attribution does have some changes for some kind of cancer. For instance, esophageal cancer is less and less due to external risks. This may be because the food people nowadays are more various and cleaner and people take drinking water more seriously than before. So people are having less chancing getting esophageal cancer due to lack of vegetable eating and water drinking. On the contrary, liver cancer are more and more due to external risks. This may have relation with the constantly increasing smoke rate of human. 5.1.2 Risk distribution over different types of cancer (1990, 2019) In the first plot, we can only see external risks as a whole. So, in the second plot above, we further explore what exactly those risks are and how people can do to prevent specific kind of cancer potentially. GHDx defines three major external risks: behavioral risks, environmental/occupational risks, and metabolic risks. From the mosaic plot above, we can see that behavioral risks are the biggest group of risks, and environmental risks are relatively the smallest group. Thus, there is a lot of things human can control to prevent them from having cancer. None of these cancers have a very even distribution of these three risks. They all bias to some one or two kinds of risks, which correspond to their features and give us suggestions on how we can fight against these cancers. We notice that cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer are almost all due to behavioral risks. That means, by controlling our behavior or actively making some changes to our life style, the risk of developing these cancers can be minimized at most. Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and uterine cancer are almost all due to metabolic risks. Metabolic risks are basically about physique of people. These risks have already built into the human body. So a better way to guard against these cancer might be to properly deal with these physical problems to avoiding them from hurting their bodies further. Finally, we can see that mesothelioma is almost all due to environmental/occupational risks. It makes sense because we know that it is mostly caused by exposure to asbestos. If people does not live in an environment with high asbestos density, then risk of getting mesothelioma is supper low. For people have to exposure to asbestos, protection is especially important. Comparing the risk proportion from 1990 to 2019, we can still see that there is not much difference. But we can indeed see that the proportion of metabolic risks increased and the proportion of behavioral risks decreased by a little. This change may indicate human have improved their behaviors to make progress against cancer, but in the mean while, increasing pressure also cause more other physical and metabolic problems that lead to getting cancer. 5.1.3 Death Number and Rate by Risks over the 30 years (1990-2019) When talking about behavioral risks or metabolic risks, it is still a little bit abstract and general. So, to get an even better understanding of all these risks for cancer, we sum up the data for every year and created a tree map to break down the risk categories into even deeper levels. In the above tree map, the area means the average number of people death from cancer because of the risk stated per year, the color means death rate (number of deaths per 100k people). We can clearly see that tobacco is definitely the most common and dangerous carcinogen. It leads to the largest number of people to die from cancer and has the largest death rate as well. For risks from environment, air pollution and occupational risks are the two major components. So people might want to wear face masks and make good protection against the environmental attack. For metabolic risks, high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose are the two main causes. That means people with obesity and high blood sugar need special attention for cancer prevention. 5.1.4 Death Rate by Sex and Age for Different Risks For this plot, we again pay attention to the three main risk categories. But this time, we focus on people of different sex and age because the cancers that men and women have are very different. First we can see that for babies and kids (age 0 to 14), the death rate of all the risks are 0. That makes sense since kids and babies are very unlikely to have cancer. Even if they have, they have a longer year of life with disability and are extremely unlikely to die before 14 years old. And the same situation holds for teenagers and people of prime. It shows that cancer favors older people. For age group form 50 to 74 years old, we now can see some variations among male and female and risks. For metabolic risk, the death rates of male and female are almost the same with males’ slightly higher. As for environmental risk, women’s death rate is very close to 0 while men’s death rate is a little more significantly higher. For behavioral risk, the difference between men and women is even more significant. And this kind of gap is even more obvious among 75 plus elders. Except for metabolic risk where the death rate of both mean are women are much higher than other age groups, death rate of elder women is almost the same as that of 50 to 74 age group, but death rate of elder men is dramatically higher. It indicate that among elders, cancer favors elder men. So men should be more careful about these risks, especially behavioral risk, to reduce their probability of getting cancer, for example, they should think of quit smoking, each more vegeables, and drink less alcohol. Over the 30 years, environmental risks has always been the leading role of causing cancer, death rate came from metabolic risk increases, while death rate came from environmental risk and behavioral risk started to decrease since 2008. These results all further confirm the conclusion I got from the previous plots. 5.2 question 2 5.3 question 3 "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Interactive Plot Interactive Plot Year 1990 Year 1995 Year 2000 Year 2005 Year 2010 Year 2015 Year 2019 "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons 7.2 Limitations 7.3 Further Direction", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons In this project, we have explore the cancer data in several interesting aspects: risks, country development, and progress. Based on our findings, we learned a lot about cancer and got the answers to our proposed questions at the very beginning. The relative contribution of genetic factors versus external factors has always been a dominant topic within cancer research. By analyzing the share of cancer deaths attributed to risk factors, we found that for around 1/3 of the cancer types, the share of death due to external factors are more than 50%. Risk factors contains 3 main categories: behavioral risk, environmental/occupational risk, and metabolic risk. Among these risk types, behavioral risk is at the leading position of causing deaths from cancer. And the biggest portion of behavioral risks is tobacco. We also found out that cancer favors elder men. And it is naturally connected with a deduction that elder men have high death rate from cancer because some behaviors like smoking, drinking, and been crapulent. Over the 30 years, the life quality of people keeps improving which leads to a lower ratio of cancer death due to behavioral risk. But at the same time, people are also able to eat better and eat a lot more high-calorie and high-sweet food, which leads to higher ratio of cancer death attributed to metabolic problem such as high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose. So nowadays, good life style and healthy eating habit might be the best way of preventing having cancers. 7.2 Limitations The variables in our dataset is a little bit limited 7.3 Further Direction If we would like to further improve our project, we would like to get data set on survival rate to better analyze the progress human has made against cancer.
