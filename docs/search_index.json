GHDx is a catalog of global health and demographic data. It provides statistics and other information about all kinds of diseases for different countries and for the globe as a whole. We use the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) Results Tool built inside to generate our datasets about cancer in different aspects. The tool allows retrieval of GBD results and provides several variables for people to choose and combine. A brief introduction about the contents this tool supplies are as follows: Base: This menu provides 2 choices: Single means single year estimates, Change means multi-year estimates for select year ranges Location: This menu provides GBD super regions, regions, countries, subnational units, and custom regions (WHO regions, World Bank Income Levels, and more) to choose from Year: 1990-2019 Context: This menu defines the type of indicator results people can access. It contains all GBD causes, risks, impairments, injuries by nature, etiology, etc. Once we select one of these results, a new drop-down menu about that result (varialbe) will appear and we can choose the values of our interest. Age: All GBD age groups Metric(units): The choices are number, rate, and percent Measure: The choices are deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), prevalence, incidence, life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), maternal mortality ratio (MMR), and summary exposure value (SEV) Sex: The choices are male, female, and both If we generates the results for all measures for every single entry of the above menus, the dataset will be so huge and complicated since it contains data for countries all over the world for 30 years. So, to better conduct our analysis on several focuses, we generated three major datasets from GBD Results Tool and each group member was responsible for creating their dataset to solve corresponding questions. World Bank collects and provides large amount of global development data and was used as data supplement of countries’ statistics in our dataset. Details about the datasets are as follows: 2.1 The Effect of Genetic Factors on Cancer Dataset: risk.csv The dataset is created from GBD Results Tool by choosing risk as context. Table 2.1: Risk Data Desription Column Name Description measure Variable name of interest (chr) location Location (chr) sex Sex (chr) age Age group (chr) cause Cancer type (chr) rei Risk type (chr) metric Unit of measure (chr) year Year (num) val Value of measure with corresponding metric (num) upper Upper bound of val (num) lower Lower bound of val (num) Issues with this dataset: The column “location” only has one value “Global” so it is not a useful variable in the dataset. And the columns “upper” and “lower” give a boundaries to “val”. In this project, we only used the “val” provided and not consider the range of “val”. So, “upper” and “lower” columns were also not used. The unused columns need to be removed. All the measures are assigned with three metrics: number, percent, and rate. Some metrics are not suitable to be used on some measures. For instance, percentage of years of life lost does not make much sense. So, we might consider deleting some meaningless or unused metrics to decrease data size. The dataset is not tidy. Column “measure” actually contains the variables of our interests. And “val” stores the values of corresponding variable. This dataset needs to be pivot to a tidy format. 2.2 question 2 2.3 question 3 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 The Effect of Genetic Factors on Cancer 3.2 question 2 3.3 question 3", " Chapter 3 Data transformation All of our datasets generated from GBD results tool need to be pre-processed as they are not in a tidy format originally. Please go to our github repo chapter to see code in detail. 3.1 The Effect of Genetic Factors on Cancer For the risk data, we first removed the used columns “location”, “upper” and “lower”. And then we pivoted our dataset so that the combinations of measure and metric became new columns (variables) in the wider tidy data and values in val were placed in the corresponding entries. We also updated the columns names of our new data frame so that these names are more precise. Finally, noticed that all of our columns of character type have limited number of categories, we transformed all character columns into factors. After data cleaning and transformation, our cancer_risk data frame has much less rows and contains only meaningful variables. ## tibble [36,000 × 14] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ sex : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Both&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;,..: 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 ... ## $ age : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;0 to 14&quot;,&quot;15-49 years&quot;,..: 2 2 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 4 ... ## $ cause : Factor w/ 23 levels &quot;Bladder cancer&quot;,..: 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 ... ## $ risk : Factor w/ 14 levels &quot;Air pollution&quot;,..: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ... ## $ year : Factor w/ 30 levels &quot;1990&quot;,&quot;1991&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Deaths_Number : num [1:36000] 21570.35 8355.76 29926.1 5.43 3.64 ... ## $ Deaths_Percent: num [1:36000] 0.3296 0.3193 0.3267 0.0413 0.0412 ... ## $ Deaths_Rate : num [1:36000] 1.569562 0.624541 1.103391 0.000603 0.000427 ... ## $ YLDs_Number : num [1:36000] 6382.45 2559.43 8941.88 1.89 1.28 ... ## $ YLDs_Percent : num [1:36000] 0.3198 0.3036 0.3151 0.0415 0.0413 ... ## $ YLDs_Rate : num [1:36000] 0.464418 0.191301 0.329692 0.00021 0.000151 ... ## $ YLLs_Number : num [1:36000] 992117 393046 1385162 415 278 ... ## $ YLLs_Percent : num [1:36000] 0.3265 0.3162 0.3236 0.0413 0.0412 ... ## $ YLLs_Rate : num [1:36000] 72.1911 29.3777 51.0716 0.0461 0.0326 ... 3.2 question 2 3.3 question 3 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 question 1 4.2 question 2 4.3 question 3", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 question 1 First take a look at our original data set: ## # A tibble: 6 × 11 ## measure location sex age cause rei metric year val upper lower ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Deaths Global Both All Ages Trachea… Air p… Rate 2019 5.01 6.33 3.72 ## 2 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Tobac… Rate 2019 1.85 2.50 1.23 ## 3 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Alcoh… Rate 2019 1.30 1.64 0.990 ## 4 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… High … Rate 2019 1.26 2.75 0.308 ## 5 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… High … Rate 2019 1.11 1.76 0.605 ## 6 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Dieta… Rate 2019 4.73 5.71 3.53 Our original dataset is downloaded from the source https://ghdx.healthdata.org/. It shows the information about in the global scale in 2019, the death rates of each kind of cancer caused by different external risks for all ages. We can see that the dataset is not in a tidy format. There are many useless variables that only contains one value. So below we transformed the data into a tidy format using only the variables of our interests. ## Air pollution Tobacco Alcohol use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 5.007384 17.5615609 NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA 1.8472622 1.302482 ## Kidney cancer NA 0.3893515 NA ## Cervical cancer NA 0.3894900 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA 1.0018858 NA ## High fasting plasma glucose ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 2.3140498 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.2611637 ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer 0.2949716 ## High body-mass index Dietary risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 0.9976335 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.1099461 4.7270238 ## Kidney cancer 0.4097576 NA ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer 0.4715473 NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Low physical activity Occupational risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 3.745323794 ## Colon and rectum cancer 0.7580853 NA ## Kidney cancer NA 0.001015075 ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Unsafe sex Other environmental risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 1.08179 ## Colon and rectum cancer NA NA ## Kidney cancer NA NA ## Cervical cancer 3.624948 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Drug use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer NA After transformation, we get a new data frame. Each observation is the death rates of one kind of cancer caused by different external risks. There is a lot of missing values in our dataset because not all types of cancer are related to all kinds of risks. For example, some types of cancer may be induced by air pollution, but will not be induced by alcohol use. In order to see the relationship between cancer types and external risks, we analyze the missing values in this data frame below. From the missing pattern plot we can see that for each of the risks air pollution, drug use, other environmental risks, unsafe sex and low physical activity, their values are missing for all other types of cancer except one. That means theses risks are highly correlated to one specific kind of cancer and people need to be care of those risks if they would like to avoid the specific types of cancer. We can also see that if data is missing for risk air pollution, then it is likely to be missing in for other environmental risks. It makes sense since air pollution is also one kind of environmental risk. It is chosen to be a separated variable because it accounts for a large proportion of environmental risks. Another thing of our notice is that risk tobacco is almost not missing for all kinds of cancer, which means it can be the induction of the majority types of cancer. So in order to protect ourselves from being attacked by cancer, we should try to avoid use tobacco a lot. We do not have a complete case here because no type of cancer would be induced by all the external risks. Below, by explicitly drawing missing values in each observation, we can have a better understanding of similarities in different kinds of cancer. From the plot above, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is affected by external risks the most since it can be induced by majority of the risks listed. It also has the highest death rate because we can see many of the blocks are yellow which means the rate is very high. Uterine cancer, thyroid cancer and gallbladder and biliary tract cancer have the same missing pattern. Colon and rectum cancer and breast cancer have same missing pattern. It suggests that there might be some similarity in these kinds of cancer, though not obvious now, but may help people find treatment to these types of cancer. Nasopharynx cancer and larynx cancer have same missing pattern. Other pharynx cancer and lip and oral cavity cancer have same missing pattern. And these two missing patterns are also similar to each other. It makes sense since they are all related to throat. 4.2 question 2 4.3 question 3 "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 question 1 5.2 question 2 5.3 question 3", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 question 1 5.2 question 2 5.3 question 3 "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
