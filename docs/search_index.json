Cancer seriously affects the emotional, physical, and mental state of patients. In the years after cancer patients are diagnosed, their quality of life will drastically decrease. For the physiological side effects of advanced cancer treatment, such as impaired fertility, sexual dysfunction, hair loss, and weight gain, patients will feel inferior or even will be discriminated against. Especially for families with poor financial status, not only must they consider whether they can afford medical expenses, but also how to face and deal with the despair and fear of death of cancer patients. Therefore, family members of cancer patients are also under tremendous psychological pressure, and their physical and mental health is also affected. Sometimes some patients cannot effectively control cancer pain with drugs, which will have a great impact on the patient’s quality of life and psychological pressure, including anxiety, despair, and fear. Therefore, understanding and coping with the emotional, mental and physical trauma of cancer to humans will maximize the quality of life of cancer patients and their families. Modern medicine has invested considerable human and material resources in cancer research for a long time, and has gradually understood and understood the causes of cancer; the diagnosis of cancer has made considerable progress due to advances in science and technology. In order to alleviate everyone’s anxiety about cancer, we would like to learn more about cancer in different aspects, including potential ways to prevent having cancer in advance, relationship between cancer impact and country development, and see whether the world has really made progress against cancer in this project. Specifically, we will combine different data visualization methods and frames to explore the deeply recent situation of cancer around the world and the progress in the medical realm against cancer. In this project, three questions that we would like to persue are as follows: By how much is all kinds of cancer caused by external factors? What is the relationship between cancer death rate and level of development (population, GDP, income, inequality, and so on) of a country? How does the world make propress against cancer over time? To answer the questions above, we collected our cancer data from Global health Data Exchange. The data source we find includes data on many different aspect of cancer, including cancer prevalence, cancer mortality over time, causes of cancer and so on. From these data source, we can get the information that how cancer is relating to our world that it not only affects each family but also influence sundry countries. During this pandemic, the discussion one health problems should be on the agenda urgently. Via merging different tables, we can extract the data we need, and find the conclusion of our above cancer related questions. For more details about our project, please refer to here to go to our Github repository and navigate our code. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Data on Cancer by Risk 2.2 Data on Cancer by Country Development 2.3 Data on Cancer over Time", " Chapter 2 Data sources The primary data source for this project is Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and World Bank. GHDx is a catalog of global health and demographic data. It provides statistics and other information about all kinds of diseases for different countries and for the globe as a whole. We use the GBD (Global Burden of Disease) Results Tool built inside to generate our datasets about cancer in different aspects. The tool allows retrieval of GBD results and provides several variables for people to choose and combine. A brief introduction about the contents this tool supplies are as follows: Base: This menu provides 2 choices: Single means single year estimates, Change means multi-year estimates for select year ranges Location: This menu provides GBD super regions, regions, countries, subnational units, and custom regions (WHO regions, World Bank Income Levels, and more) to choose from Year: 1990-2019 Context: This menu defines the type of indicator results people can access. It contains all GBD causes, risks, impairments, injuries by nature, etiology, etc. Once we select one of these results, a new drop-down menu about that result (varialbe) will appear and we can choose the values of our interest. Age: All GBD age groups Metric(units): The choices are number, rate, and percent Measure: The choices are deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), prevalence, incidence, life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), maternal mortality ratio (MMR), and summary exposure value (SEV) Sex: The choices are male, female, and both If we generates the results for all measures for every single entry of the above menus, the dataset will be so huge and complicated since it contains data for countries all over the world for 30 years. So, to better conduct our analysis on several focuses, we generated three major datasets from GBD Results Tool and each group member was responsible for creating their dataset to solve corresponding questions. World Bank collects and provides large amount of global development data and was used as data supplement of countries’ statistics in our dataset. Details about the datasets are as follows: 2.1 Data on Cancer by Risk Dataset: risk.csv The dataset is created from GBD Results Tool by choosing risk as context. Table 2.1: Risk Data Desription Column Name Description measure Variable name of interest (chr) location Location (chr) sex Sex (chr) age Age group (chr) cause Cancer type (chr) rei Risk type (chr) metric Unit of measure (chr) year Year (num) val Value of measure with corresponding metric (num) upper Upper bound of val (num) lower Lower bound of val (num) Issues with this dataset: The column “location” only has one value “Global” so it is not a useful variable in the dataset. And the columns “upper” and “lower” give a boundaries to “val”. In this project, we only used the “val” provided and not consider the range of “val”. So, “upper” and “lower” columns were also not used. The unused columns need to be removed. All the measures are assigned with three metrics: number, percent, and rate. Some metrics are not suitable to be used on some measures. For instance, percentage of years of life lost does not make much sense. So, we might consider deleting some meaningless or unused metrics to decrease data size. The dataset is not tidy. Column “measure” actually contains the variables of our interests. And “val” stores the values of corresponding variable. This dataset needs to be pivot to a tidy format. 2.2 Data on Cancer by Country Development Dataset: final.csv The dataset is combined with GBD results and the country dataset from World Bank. Table 2.2: Death among Countries Desription Column Name Description location Location (chr) year Year (num) number Death Number(num) GDP GDP per capita(num) GNI GNI (num) Rate Death Rate(num) Percent Death Percent(num) Health_Cost_of_GDP Current health expenditure (% of GDP) Health_Cost Current health expenditure per capita (current US$) Issues with this dataset: 1.There are only 19 countries in the dataset, which may not be supper sufficient for see the whole story on relationship between cancer death rate and country progress. 3.The dataset are not large enough to show the main trend and death are affected by multiple reasons so the analyze results might include some bias. 2.3 Data on Cancer over Time Dataset: making_progress.csv Dataset: death_number.csv The dataset is created from GBD Results Tool by choosing cause as context. Table 2.3: Making_progress_description &amp; cmp Data Desription Column Name Description measure Variable name of interest (chr) location Location (chr) sex Sex (chr) age Age group (chr) cause Cancer type (chr) metric Unit of measure (chr) year Year (num) val Value of measure with corresponding metric (num) upper Upper bound of val (num) lower Lower bound of val (num) Issues with this dataset: Same as our topic 1, the column “location” only has one value “Global” which cannot provide more information. And the columns “upper” and “lower” give a boundaries to “val”. However, we only used the “val” provided and not consider the range of “val”. Also, the the column “sex” cares about both female and male. Hence, the unused columns need to be removed. Considering that the dataset size need to be reduced, we may delete some meaningless and confusing metrics such as “YLLs percent” and “YLDs percent”. Since it take too long to download the whole dataset for different countries over 30 years. We downloaded two separated dataset with different “measure” and “age” group. That is why the two datasets have exactly the same data description. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Cancer Risk Data Transformation 3.2 Cancer by Country Data Transformation 3.3 Cancer Time Series Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation All of our datasets generated from GBD results tool need to be pre-processed as they are not in a tidy format originally. Please go to our github repo chapter to see code in detail. 3.1 Cancer Risk Data Transformation For the risk data, we first removed the used columns “location”, “upper” and “lower”. And then we pivoted our dataset so that the combinations of measure and metric became new columns (variables) in the wider tidy data and values in val were placed in the corresponding entries. We also updated the columns names of our new data frame so that these names are more precise. Finally, noticed that all of our columns of character type have limited number of categories, we transformed all character columns into factors. After data cleaning and transformation, our cancer_risk data frame has much less rows and contains only meaningful variables. ## tibble [36,000 × 14] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ sex : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Both&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;,..: 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 ... ## $ age : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;0 to 14&quot;,&quot;15-49 years&quot;,..: 2 2 2 1 1 1 3 3 3 4 ... ## $ cause : Factor w/ 23 levels &quot;Bladder cancer&quot;,..: 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 22 ... ## $ risk : Factor w/ 14 levels &quot;Air pollution&quot;,..: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ... ## $ year : Factor w/ 30 levels &quot;1990&quot;,&quot;1991&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ Deaths_Number : num [1:36000] 21570.35 8355.76 29926.1 5.43 3.64 ... ## $ Deaths_Percent: num [1:36000] 0.3296 0.3193 0.3267 0.0413 0.0412 ... ## $ Deaths_Rate : num [1:36000] 1.569562 0.624541 1.103391 0.000603 0.000427 ... ## $ YLDs_Number : num [1:36000] 6382.45 2559.43 8941.88 1.89 1.28 ... ## $ YLDs_Percent : num [1:36000] 0.3198 0.3036 0.3151 0.0415 0.0413 ... ## $ YLDs_Rate : num [1:36000] 0.464418 0.191301 0.329692 0.00021 0.000151 ... ## $ YLLs_Number : num [1:36000] 992117 393046 1385162 415 278 ... ## $ YLLs_Percent : num [1:36000] 0.3265 0.3162 0.3236 0.0413 0.0412 ... ## $ YLLs_Rate : num [1:36000] 72.1911 29.3777 51.0716 0.0461 0.0326 ... 3.2 Cancer by Country Data Transformation The original dataset of countries contains more than 2000 rows of basic information of each countries so here we pick important factors towards to death rate including GDP, GNI, health cost per capita and health cost percent of total GDP. Besides, we also spread the measure of cancer death including percent, rate and number. Here, we also add a year column.

And then we pivoted our dataset so that the combinations of measure and metric became new columns (variables) in the wider tidy data and values in val were placed in the corresponding entries. To be more precise and clear, we need to change the column name for the metric. ## tibble [840 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ age : chr [1:840] &quot;Age-standardized&quot; &quot;Age-standardized&quot; &quot;Age-standardized&quot; &quot;Age-standardized&quot; ... ## $ cause : chr [1:840] &quot;Esophageal cancer&quot; &quot;Stomach cancer&quot; &quot;Liver cancer&quot; &quot;Larynx cancer&quot; ... ## $ year : num [1:840] 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 ... ## $ DALYs_Rate : num [1:840] 199 493 258 59 658 ... ## $ Deaths_Rate : num [1:840] 8.18 20.48 8.93 2.19 27.3 ... ## $ YLLs_Rate : num [1:840] 197.2 487.9 256.4 57.4 651.4 ... ## $ YLDs_Percent: num [1:840] 0.000191 0.000499 0.000181 0.000145 0.000594 ... ## $ YLDs_Rate : num [1:840] 2.12 5.52 2 1.61 6.56 ... ## tibble [840 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ age : chr [1:840] &quot;All Ages&quot; &quot;All Ages&quot; &quot;All Ages&quot; &quot;All Ages&quot; ... ## $ cause : chr [1:840] &quot;Esophageal cancer&quot; &quot;Stomach cancer&quot; &quot;Liver cancer&quot; &quot;Leukemia&quot; ... ## $ year : num [1:840] 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 1990 ... ## $ Deaths_Number: num [1:840] 319332 788317 365215 263263 7224 ... "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Cancer Risk Dataset 4.2 Cancer by Country Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Cancer Risk Dataset The original risk data frame does not have any missing values since GBD Results Tool has already ignored all the observations with missing value. So I get another smaller dataset to get another perspective of missing value and the dataset is as follows: ## # A tibble: 6 × 11 ## measure location sex age cause rei metric year val upper lower ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Deaths Global Both All Ages Trachea… Air p… Rate 2019 5.01 6.33 3.72 ## 2 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Tobac… Rate 2019 1.85 2.50 1.23 ## 3 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Alcoh… Rate 2019 1.30 1.64 0.990 ## 4 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… High … Rate 2019 1.26 2.75 0.308 ## 5 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… High … Rate 2019 1.11 1.76 0.605 ## 6 Deaths Global Both All Ages Colon a… Dieta… Rate 2019 4.73 5.71 3.53 Our original dataset is downloaded from the source https://ghdx.healthdata.org/. It shows the information about in the global scale in 2019, the death rates of each kind of cancer caused by different external risks for all ages. We can see that the dataset is not in a tidy format. There are many useless variables that only contains one value. So below we transformed the data into a tidy format using only the variables of our interests. ## Air pollution Tobacco Alcohol use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 5.007384 17.5615609 NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA 1.8472622 1.302482 ## Kidney cancer NA 0.3893515 NA ## Cervical cancer NA 0.3894900 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA 1.0018858 NA ## High fasting plasma glucose ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer 2.3140498 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.2611637 ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer 0.2949716 ## High body-mass index Dietary risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 0.9976335 ## Colon and rectum cancer 1.1099461 4.7270238 ## Kidney cancer 0.4097576 NA ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer 0.4715473 NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Low physical activity Occupational risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 3.745323794 ## Colon and rectum cancer 0.7580853 NA ## Kidney cancer NA 0.001015075 ## Cervical cancer NA NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Unsafe sex Other environmental risks ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA 1.08179 ## Colon and rectum cancer NA NA ## Kidney cancer NA NA ## Cervical cancer 3.624948 NA ## Uterine cancer NA NA ## Bladder cancer NA NA ## Drug use ## Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer NA ## Colon and rectum cancer NA ## Kidney cancer NA ## Cervical cancer NA ## Uterine cancer NA ## Bladder cancer NA After transformation, we get a new data frame. Each observation is the death rates of one kind of cancer caused by different external risks. There is a lot of missing values in our dataset because not all types of cancer are related to all kinds of risks. For example, some types of cancer may be induced by air pollution, but will not be induced by alcohol use. In order to see the relationship between cancer types and external risks, we analyze the missing values in this data frame below. From the missing pattern plot we can see that for each of the risks air pollution, drug use, other environmental risks, unsafe sex and low physical activity, their values are missing for all other types of cancer except one. That means theses risks are highly correlated to one specific kind of cancer and people need to be care of those risks if they would like to avoid the specific types of cancer. We can also see that if data is missing for risk air pollution, then it is likely to be missing in for other environmental risks. It makes sense since air pollution is also one kind of environmental risk. It is chosen to be a separated variable because it accounts for a large proportion of environmental risks. Another thing of our notice is that risk tobacco is almost not missing for all kinds of cancer, which means it can be the induction of the majority types of cancer. So in order to protect ourselves from being attacked by cancer, we should try to avoid use tobacco a lot. We do not have a complete case here because no type of cancer would be induced by all the external risks. Below, by explicitly drawing missing values in each observation, we can have a better understanding of similarities in different kinds of cancer. From the plot above, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is affected by external risks the most since it can be induced by majority of the risks listed. It also has the highest death rate because we can see many of the blocks are yellow which means the rate is very high. Uterine cancer, thyroid cancer and gallbladder and biliary tract cancer have the same missing pattern. Colon and rectum cancer and breast cancer have same missing pattern. It suggests that there might be some similarity in these kinds of cancer, though not obvious now, but may help people find treatment to these types of cancer. Nasopharynx cancer and larynx cancer have same missing pattern. Other pharynx cancer and lip and oral cavity cancer have same missing pattern. And these two missing patterns are also similar to each other. It makes sense since they are all related to throat. 4.2 Cancer by Country Dataset The dataset that contains the death rate and number among countries contain null variable Brazil. Besides, the health cost of GDP and health cost per capita contains many null data from 1995 to 2015. Here the missing plot can also show the fact that missing data are concentrated at health cost. The missing data of GDP and GNI are caused by Brazil in 2019. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer 5.2 Relationship between Cancer Deaths and Country Development 5.3 Is the World Making Progress against Cancers?", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Effect of External Factors on Cancer The etiology of cancer is very complicated and has not been fully understood. But it has been found that the two major causes of cancer are genetic factors and external factors. While one of the biggest fears of human comes from cancer and people usually feel helpless in the face of cancer, we should realize that keep good life style might significantly reduce our chance of getting some kind of cancer. So below we analyze the effect of external factors on cancer and give potential ways of preventing cancer. 5.1.1 Share of cancer deaths attributed to risk factors from 1990-2019 The plot above shows an estimation of share of global cancer deaths which are attributed to external risk factors over the 30 years. For example, around 71% of larynx cancer deaths are attributed to some external risk. Only the remaining 29% of deaths are assumed to have no attribution to risk factors, and would occur naturally in the absence of external factors. So, we can see that the cancers with blue bar, like cervical cancer and mesothelioma, are more caused by external risks; the cancers with red bar, like thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer, are more due to genetic factors and so that people can do less to prevent such cancers. We can notice that cervical cancer is 100% due to external risks according to the plot. It might be too extreme to say but it is a suggestion that people can definitely do a lot of things to successfully prevent having such cancer. We also observe that over the past 30 years, though the overall share of cancer deaths due to external risks is not changing dramatically, the external risk attribution does have some changes for some kind of cancer. For instance, esophageal cancer is less and less due to external risks. This may be because the food people nowadays are more various and cleaner and people take drinking water more seriously than before. So people are having less chancing getting esophageal cancer due to lack of vegetable eating and water drinking. On the contrary, liver cancer are more and more due to external risks. This may have relation with the constantly increasing smoke rate of human. 5.1.2 Risk distribution over different types of cancer (1990, 2019) In the first plot, we can only see external risks as a whole. So, in the second plot above, we further explore what exactly those risks are and how people can do to prevent specific kind of cancer potentially. GHDx defines three major external risks: behavioral risks, environmental/occupational risks, and metabolic risks. From the mosaic plot above, we can see that behavioral risks are the biggest group of risks, and environmental risks are relatively the smallest group. Thus, there is a lot of things human can control to prevent them from having cancer. None of these cancers have a very even distribution of these three risks. They all bias to some one or two kinds of risks, which correspond to their features and give us suggestions on how we can fight against these cancers. We notice that cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer are almost all due to behavioral risks. That means, by controlling our behavior or actively making some changes to our life style, the risk of developing these cancers can be minimized at most. Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer, multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and uterine cancer are almost all due to metabolic risks. Metabolic risks are basically about physique of people. These risks have already built into the human body. So a better way to guard against these cancer might be to properly deal with these physical problems to avoiding them from hurting their bodies further. Finally, we can see that mesothelioma is almost all due to environmental/occupational risks. It makes sense because we know that it is mostly caused by exposure to asbestos. If people does not live in an environment with high asbestos density, then risk of getting mesothelioma is supper low. For people have to exposure to asbestos, protection is especially important. Comparing the risk proportion from 1990 to 2019, we can still see that there is not much difference. But we can indeed see that the proportion of metabolic risks increased and the proportion of behavioral risks decreased by a little. This change may indicate human have improved their behaviors to make progress against cancer, but in the mean while, increasing pressure also cause more other physical and metabolic problems that lead to getting cancer. 5.1.3 Death Number and Rate by Risks over the 30 years (1990-2019) When talking about behavioral risks or metabolic risks, it is still a little bit abstract and general. So, to get an even better understanding of all these risks for cancer, we sum up the data for every year and created a tree map to break down the risk categories into even deeper levels. In the above tree map, the area means the average number of people death from cancer because of the risk stated per year, the color means death rate (number of deaths per 100k people). We can clearly see that tobacco is definitely the most common and dangerous carcinogen. It leads to the largest number of people to die from cancer and has the largest death rate as well. For risks from environment, air pollution and occupational risks are the two major components. So people might want to wear face masks and make good protection against the environmental attack. For metabolic risks, high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose are the two main causes. That means people with obesity and high blood sugar need special attention for cancer prevention. 5.1.4 Death Rate by Sex and Age for Different Risks For this plot, we again pay attention to the three main risk categories. But this time, we focus on people of different sex and age because the cancers that men and women have are very different. First we can see that for babies and kids (age 0 to 14), the death rate of all the risks are 0. That makes sense since kids and babies are very unlikely to have cancer. Even if they have, they have a longer year of life with disability and are extremely unlikely to die before 14 years old. And the same situation holds for teenagers and people of prime. It shows that cancer favors older people. For age group form 50 to 74 years old, we now can see some variations among male and female and risks. For metabolic risk, the death rates of male and female are almost the same with males’ slightly higher. As for environmental risk, women’s death rate is very close to 0 while men’s death rate is a little more significantly higher. For behavioral risk, the difference between men and women is even more significant. And this kind of gap is even more obvious among 75 plus elders. Except for metabolic risk where the death rate of both mean are women are much higher than other age groups, death rate of elder women is almost the same as that of 50 to 74 age group, but death rate of elder men is dramatically higher. It indicate that among elders, cancer favors elder men. So men should be more careful about these risks, especially behavioral risk, to reduce their probability of getting cancer, for example, they should think of quit smoking, each more vegeables, and drink less alcohol. Over the 30 years, environmental risks has always been the leading role of causing cancer, death rate came from metabolic risk increases, while death rate came from environmental risk and behavioral risk started to decrease since 2008. These results all further confirm the conclusion I got from the previous plots. 5.2 Relationship between Cancer Deaths and Country Development 5.2.1 Heatmap of Death Rate in World The heatmap of death rate can show the death rate among the countries shown in the world map. You can also click the run button and then we also see the death rate change from 1990 to 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the red area where death rate become higher so the color is lighter. However, from 1990 to 2019, the death rate in blue zone where death rate are high become lower when the color are lighter. 5.2.2 Bubble Plot of Death Rate vs Health Cost of GDP The bubble plot can show the death rate versus health cost of GDP. The size of bubble can also show the GDP per capita. If you move the mouse over the bubble, we can also see the name of country. The result is interesting: in most cases, higher health cost of GDP means the high death rate and higher GDP. However, America does not follow this rule: America have high health cost of GDP but the death only in the middle level. The rules are followed across the years. ## # A tibble: 72 × 9 ## location year Health_Cost_of_… Health_Cost GDP GNI Number Percent ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 United Kingdom 2000 7.28 2054. 26421. 1.56e12 1.64e5 0.271 ## 2 Zambia 2005 6.86 48.2 2186. 2.40e10 6.25e3 0.0385 ## 3 Germany 2000 9.89 2344. 27211. 2.22e12 2.42e5 0.289 ## 4 Sudan 2000 3.61 15.2 1825. 5.82e10 1.03e4 0.0410 ## 5 Mongolia 2000 4.87 27.0 3729. 8.90e 9 3.42e3 0.164 ## 6 Mexico 2000 4.45 318. 11090. 1.07e12 6.04e4 0.133 ## 7 Kenya 2000 4.64 20.5 1618. 5.12e10 9.96e3 0.0306 ## 8 Mexico 2005 5.84 483. 12658. 1.31e12 6.93e4 0.139 ## 9 Canada 2000 8.28 2008. 29363. 8.77e11 6.29e4 0.293 ## 10 Japan 2000 7.15 2741. 27283. 3.45e12 3.21e5 0.331 ## # … with 62 more rows, and 1 more variable: Rate &lt;dbl&gt; 5.2.3 Accumulated Death Among Countries In this plot, I stacked the total amount of death from 2000 to 2015. Here, it is easy to see that China has much larger amount of death than other countries. The death amount is hugely depend on the population of each countries, so many countries with small population has small death amount and countries with large population has large death amount. Interestingly, even though India and US has large population, the death amount is still much smaller than China. 5.2.4 Death Rate by GDP Here, I combine four plots of death rate by GDP from 2000 to 2015. In this plot, I only try to explore the death rate affected by GDP. The four plots show that the trend are not changed from 2000 to 2019: high GDP means high death rate. Even though high GDP mean high income and better living condition, it does not mean the death rate are lower. In highly developed countries, there are still many factors that can affect people’s health and cancer is still a big threaten to developed countries. 5.3 Is the World Making Progress against Cancers? 5.3.1 Age-standardized cancer death rates We randomly chose eight common cancers in our life to watch how their death_rate change in thirty years. We cannot only look at absolute death numbers to see if we’ve made success in the fight against cancer. It doesn’t explain the world’s population expansion. Hence, health statisticians investigate death rate, which calculates the number of cancer deaths per 100,000 individuals. It is conspicuous that the death rate shows a decreasing trend in those 30 years especially for Liver cancer, Esophageal cancer, stomach cancer and Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer. Moreover, this measure is based on Age-Standardized rate, which tells us what the death rate will be if the age structure of the population remains unchanged over time. Hence, we can say the world is making slow progress. Most deaths are caused by smoking since we can observe Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer contributes to the highest death rate globally. Here is a strong decline of death rates for lunger cancer since smoking rate is decreasing in these years. 5.3.2 The number of cancer deaths is increasing for all age The number of cancer deaths grew from roughly about 3 million in 1990 to 5 million in 2019 for those eight random cancers, as indicated in the graph. There are two causes for this, as we’ve just seen: The first is that the global population is growing, which is followed by an increase in the annual death toll. The second major reason is that the world has made significant progress in decreasing causes of mortality that used to kill individuals young, particularly infectious illnesses.This indicates that the world’s population is aging, and an increasing number of individuals are dying of cancer and other causes. We may predict a rise in the number of individuals dying early as the globe grows wealthier. The number of cancer deaths grew from roughly about 3 million in 1990 to 5 million in 2019 for those eight random cancers, as indicated in the graph. Evidently, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer contributes most to the death numbers for “All age”. As we discussed before, it also plays an critical role in age-standardized death rate. Stomach cancer is the second big reason that lead to the death globally. Mesothelioma is the least cancer that result in death. From what the figure shown, we found there is a obvious increase in death number. There are two causes for this the first is that the global population is growing, which is followed by an increase in the annual death toll. The second major reason is that the world has made significant progress in decreasing causes of death that can be detected at an individual’s young age. Since the development of technology such as the creation of advanced instruments and the doctor’s outstanding medical skills, some disease may not develop to cancer. However, there is still an increase in death number; that is, the population of the world is aging and this means when people are getting old, they will die because of cancer. Also, this reason is a natural occurrences when people getting old. Also, we can predict that the death number would continuously increase since diseases may not transfer to cancer because of the prevention by advanced medical technology. 5.3.3 Year of life lost rate is decreasing. The plot above shows an estimation on cancer patients’ years of life lost rate from 1990 to 2019 based on eight random cancers. By dragging the time line, we can easily find that there is a big decrease of the year of life lost rate. Also, the rate is calculated by adding the year of life lost rate for 100k people that got this cancer. The decrease in year of life lost rate means people who got thee cancer can live longer than that 30 years before. As we can seen the purple line which is the year of life lost rate for people who got tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer decrease from 651 to 544, that is decreased by 16.4%. What’s more the most red line which represents the year of life lost rate for people who got stomach cancer decrease from 487 to 264, which is decreased by 46%. This is a huge change. I believe the reason leads to the huge change must rely on the world’s making progress. For example, patients can be treated at once. People get richer and they can afford the fee to do the operations if they were detected early-stage cancer. 5.3.4 The tend of rate of years for who is living with disability is flat or increase a little. The plot above shows an estimation on cancer patients’ years of living with disability from 1990 to 2019 based on eight random cancers. Also, the rate is calculated by adding the year of living with disability rate for 100k people that got this cancer. The red line which represents the breast cancer shows a little bit increase, which means people who lived with breast cancer live longer now than 30 years before. Also, the green one with rectangle shape and the blue one with snow shape increase a little bit as well. They represent people’s living year with Kidney cancer and Nasopharynx cancer. However, other line such as the purple one which represents the Stomach cancer surprising is decreasing. The little increase may related to the world progress on the advanced medical equipment as we discussed before. Also, breast cancer usually be detected among women. A good mood and an optimistic attitude is the most factor that can live longer. What’s more, the society is more likely to value equality than that before and women plays a more important role in this world which can also be the reason. For the decrease on Stomach cancer, I think the reason is that unhealthy instant food is filled in people’s life. Also, keeping staying up late becomes the norm among people. Hence, cancer patients’ years of living with these disability a little bit decrease.

It shows the death rate of 19 chosen countries from year 1990 to year 2019 with every 5 years apart (except for 2019 since we do not have data for 2020). By clicking the “year” button in order, we can clearly see how and how fast the death rate increases over years. If look carefully, we can notice that the death rate for Japan always increases at a fast rate. It is surprising since people may think developed country should have excellent medical facility and so lead to slow increasing in cancer death rate. But the plot shows that developed countries actually have larger increasing rate of cancer death rate than that of developing and under developed country. Year 1990 Year 1995 Year 2000 Year 2005 Year 2010 Year 2015 Year 2019 "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons 7.2 Limitations 7.3 Further Direction", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons In this project, we have explore the cancer data in several interesting aspects: risks, country development, and progress. Based on our findings, we learned a lot about cancer and got the answers to our proposed questions at the very beginning. The relative contribution of genetic factors versus external factors has always been a dominant topic within cancer research. By analyzing the share of cancer deaths attributed to risk factors, we found that for around 1/3 of the cancer types, the share of death due to external factors are more than 50%. Risk factors contains 3 main categories: behavioral risk, environmental/occupational risk, and metabolic risk. Among these risk types, behavioral risk is at the leading position of causing deaths from cancer. And the biggest portion of behavioral risks is tobacco. We also found out that cancer favors elder men. And it is naturally connected with a deduction that elder men have high death rate from cancer because some behaviors like smoking, drinking, and been crapulent. Over the 30 years, the life quality of people keeps improving which leads to a lower ratio of cancer death due to behavioral risk. But at the same time, people are also able to eat better and eat a lot more high-calorie and high-sweet food, which leads to higher ratio of cancer death attributed to metabolic problem such as high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose. Moreover, the unhealthy living style may related to the decrease in the patient’s living year with disability. For example, the living-year-rate for people who live with stomach cancer do not increase; conversely, it has decreased in thirty years. This may related to unhealthy habits. So nowadays, good life style and healthy eating habit might be crucial factors to prevent having cancers. Overall, the death rate decreases evidently over 30 years but the death number increases. Those occurrences are both the product of the development of the world. Since the rapid improvement of advanced equipment and doctor’s medical skills, cancers can be cured at the first stage. Hence, the population of the world is aging which leads to the increase in death number. Moreover, the rapid development have a positive influence on early-stage cancer patients, which makes them live in a longer life than that 30 years before. 7.2 Limitations The variables in our dataset is a little bit limited since it do not have enough features to show the reason that leads to the decrease in dealth rate and the increase in death number. The factor such as world population growth or the application of some advanced equipment can be explored and added into dataset. 7.3 Further Direction If we would like to further improve our project, we would like to get data set on survival rate to better analyze the progress human has made against cancer.
